Introduction

This includes all necessary resources to build and implement my blog (live at http://blog.propellerhead.dk).
The blog was developed in Python and runs on Google App Engine. The solution was initially created as a learning 
project migrating an existing solution originally developed in C# (ASP.NET) to Python and Google Appe Engine, 
but is today the sole implementation of this blog.
